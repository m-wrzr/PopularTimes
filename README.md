# Populartimes
The goal of this script is to provide an option to use Google Maps popular times data, until it is available via Google's API.

## How to get started
+ Get a Google Maps API key https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/ (for more than 1000 reqests/sec add payment information).
+ Install the wheel via: `pip3 install populartimes-2.0-py3.whl` or `python setup.py install`
+ `import populartimes` and run with `populartimes.get(...)`

## Calling populartimes.get
+ `populartimes.get(api_key, types, bound_lower, bound_upper, n_threads=20, radius=180, all_places=False):`
    + **api_key** str; api key from google places web service; e.g. "your-api-key"
    + **types** [str]; placetypes; see https://developers.google.com/places/supported_types; e.g. ["bar"]
    + **bound_lower** (float, float); lat/lng of southwest point; e.g. (48.132986, 11.566126)
    + **bound_upper** (float, float); lat/lng of northeast point; e.g. (48.142199, 11.580047)
    + **n_threads (opt)** int; number of threads used; e.g. 20
    + **radius (opt)** int; meters; from 1-180 for radar search; e.g. 180
    + **all_places (opt)** bool; include/exclude places without populartimes

+ example call
    
	`populartimes.get("your-api-key", ["bar"], (48.132986, 11.566126), (48.142199, 11.580047))`

See also the examples in `tests/test.py`.
